**Unit 2: Understanding Customers, Target Marketing, and Market
Segmentation** <span id="2"></span> 
*When an organization thinks about marketing as a transaction—that is,
as an exchange of goods or services between the organization and the
customer—it is important for the organization to consider who its
potential customers might be and how it can identify these people. This
information helps a company decide what types of products and/or
services it will offer, as well as how it will communicate to potential
customers about the availability of its offerings (its products and/or
services). How well a company understands its customers—its market—may
also influence how the company develops its products and/or services.
Without customers to purchase its offerings, a company doesn’t have a
business.*  
    
 *A company may identify its customers by targeting demographic and
psychographic characteristics. Demographics and psychographics refer to
qualities that marketing professionals use to describe the potential
customers for a product or service. These characteristics may include
customers’ likes and dislikes as well as family income, gender, and/or
education level. Following the research phase, a company may divide (or
segment) its customers into target markets and begin to develop
strategic sales leads for more successful sales transactions. In this
unit of the course, you will learn more about understanding customers,
identifying customers, and segmenting customer groups into specific
markets.*

     Instructions: Read this chapter, which discusses a consumer’s
    decision-making process and examines the situational, personal,
    psychological, and social factors that have an impact on consumer
    buying decisions. Understanding the behavior of potential customers
    will help you understand how a company communicates with customers
    and what offerings a company might develop in order to attract
    specific types of customers. Be sure to take notes as you read and
    respond to the discussion questions (but not the activities)
    provided at the end of this chapter.  
      
     Reading this chapter, taking notes, and responding to the

     Instructions: Watch this video, which discusses the concepts of
    publicsand demographics. To understand its potential customers, a
    company needs to be able to describe its customer groups (or
    publics) by common characteristics, also known as demographics. In
    this video, Dr. Steven Van Hook describes the key publics and
    demographics that affect a company’s segmentation process (a process
    that will be laid out in detail in Subunit 2.2, found below). Be
    sure to take notes as you watch this video.  
        
     Watching this video and taking notes should take approximately 30
    minutes.

**2.2 Target Marketing and Segmentation** <span id="2.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: *Principles of Marketing*: “Chapter 5: Market Segmenting,
    Targeting, and Positioning”**
    Link: *Principles of Marketing*: [“Chapter 5: Market Segmenting,
    Targeting, and
    Positioning”](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/textbooks/Principles%20of%20Marketing.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read this chapter. You will learn more about *mass
    marketing *and *targeted marketing*, two distinct types of marketing
    strategies. Most companies today engage in targeted marketing
    because it is a more cost-effective strategy. Segmenting a market,
    targeting selected customer groups, and positioning specific
    offerings are important steps for launching a successful
    targeted-marketing campaign. Be sure to take notes as you read and
    respond to the discussion questions (but not the activities)
    provided at the end of this chapter.  
      
     Reading this chapter, taking notes, and responding to the
    discussion questions should take approximately 2 hours.

**2.3 Marketing Research** <span id="2.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: *Principles of Marketing*: “Chapter 10: Gathering and
    Using Information: Marketing Research and Market Intelligence”**
    Link: *Principles of Marketing*: [“Chapter 10: Gathering and Using
    Information: Marketing Research and Market
    Intelligence”](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/textbooks/Principles%20of%20Marketing.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read this chapter, which explores marketing research
    techniques, the concept of *market intelligence*, and the
    information systems that organizations use to manage the data that
    result from these processes. As you read, note that all
    organizations and companies use many forms of information to learn
    more about their potential customers and their potential
    competition. Understanding potential customers is very important.
    Without customers, a business will not be successful. And without a
    means to gather information about its customers, a company will not
    be able to increase its outreach to important populations and, by
    extension, increase its sales potential. Understanding potential
    customers also helps a company compete with other service providers,
    since a company’s competitors are trying to reach the same customer
    groups. Be sure to take notes as you read and respond to the
    discussion questions (but not the activities) provided at the end of
    this chapter.  
      
     Reading this chapter, taking notes, and responding to the
    discussion questions should take approximately 2 hours.
