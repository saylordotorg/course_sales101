**Unit 1: Marketing and Society** <span id="1"></span> 

*Marketing is the process of creating products and services that meet
the needs of customers who seek to buy those goods and services. We
engage in the marketing process almost every day of our lives—usually as
a customer. From buying a lunchtime meal to shopping for a birthday gift
to paying a bill online, we are exposed to marketing campaigns run by
both commercial entities and nonprofit organizations. By engaging in
exchanges for goods and services, we participate in a transactional
model that is the basis for most marketing campaigns. As such, marketing
includes strategies that an organization enacts in order to best present
(and sell) its products and/or services to potential customers. *

*The marketing mix is built from four components, known as the four Ps
of marketing: product, promotion, price, and placement. (Note that a
product can also be a service, and placement may alternately be referred
to as distribution.) *

*In the first unit of this course, you will learn about the four Ps and
other basics of contemporary marketing. You also will explore in detail
how the first stage of the marketing process—planning—is critical to a
successful marketing campaign.*

     Instructions: Watch this video, in which Dr. Van Hook uses engaging
    examples to explain the basic elements of *the marketing mix*. Since
    there would be no sales of products or services without customers,
    Dr. Van Hook discusses the importance of understanding the mindset
    of the people who might buy an organization’s offerings. Dr. Van
    Hook also introduces another four-part marketing model: *the* *four
    Cs of marketing*, a concept that considers marketing transactions
    from the customer’s point of view. The four Cs focus on the value of
    the customer and the value that the customer places on a
    transaction. The concepts discussed in this video will inform your
    understanding of the ideas that are presented in the next unit of
    this course. Be sure to take notes as you watch this video.  
      
     Watching this video and taking notes should take approximately 30
