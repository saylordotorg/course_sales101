*Simply put, promotions are all about how a company or organization
communicates with its customers about its products and/or services—that
is, how a company or organization lets potential customers know about
the products and/or services it offers. Common forms of promotion
include advertising, person-to-person sales, sales promotions, direct
marketing, and publicity.*  
    
 *Now that you have a better understanding of how a business identifies
and attracts potential customers, you can consider how a company
communicates with these customers regarding goods and services for sale.
In this unit, you will explore common promotional tactics that
businesses and organizations use to garner consumer interest and,
ultimately, consumer sales.*

    *integrated marketing communications* (IMC). Be sure to take notes
