This short course will introduce you to the basic elements of marketing
for businesses and nonprofit organizations. If you are taking this
course to fulfill the requirements of Saylor’s Sales Certificate
program, it is important that you understand the broad fundamentals of
marketing, since sales is only one component of the greater business
concept of marketing. To that end, this course will introduce you to
important marketing basics and help prepare you for some of the typical
entry-level expectations for sales and marketing associates. A few of
these required skills include helping coordinate the execution of
marketing plans; developing plans for promotional campaigns; writing
sales and marketing materials; participating in marketing research and
competitive analyses; identifying potential clients; assisting with
advertising campaigns; and participating in customer relationship
management. As frequent consumers of products and services, we
participate in sales transactions on a regular basis. Indeed, many
aspects of our daily routines often involve such purchases. For example,
as you drive to work in the morning, you may stop to buy gas for your
car. While filling up at the gas station, you may also buy a cup of
coffee. These examples of common sales transactions are part of the
larger business process of marketing. The specific ways in which you
purchase goods and services—for example, stopping at a certain gas
station because it is closest to your home, or because it offers the
lowest fuel price, or because it sells high-performance fuel—are
influenced by different components of the marketing process, also known
as *the* *marketing mix*. As a sales or marketing associate, you may be
asked to participate in strategic thinking about how consumers make
complex purchasing decisions. This process will require you to consider
the four components of traditional marketing mixes, also known as *the*
*four Ps* *of marketing*: product, promotion, price, and placement. By
the end of this course, you will have an understanding of the basic
concepts of marketing and be able to apply them to your own career in
marketing. You also will be able to build on the core ideas of the
marketing mix in order to identify and discuss the specific role of
sales in the marketing process. No matter what product or service you
are selling, understanding the role that sales plays in a successful
marketing plan will be a critical component to your career success.
