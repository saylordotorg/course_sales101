**Unit 4: Developing and Managing Products** <span id="4"></span> 
*Other important components of the marketing process include the
development and management of products and services. Such management
includes understanding a product’s life cycle and the role that
marketing plays in that cycle. In this unit you will explore the
remaining elements of the marketing mix: product, price, and placement
(distribution). As you have learned while working through your course
assignments and activities thus far, many people affect an
organization’s offerings (its products and/or services). For example, if
you are employed by a large toy store (a retailer) as a member of its
sales and marketing department, you may have no control over the
specific toys that the company buyers have placed in the store. But you
do need to understand how marketing affects and is affected by a
product’s life cycle. A product’s life cycle will influence the
product’s price and placement—which in turn inform how you, as a sales
associate, approach sales transactions with potential customers.*
