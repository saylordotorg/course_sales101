**Unit 5: Customer Relationship Management** <span id="5"></span> 
*Identifying who a company’s potential customers might be and how a
company maintains its relationships with these customers are two very
different processes. In Unit 2 of this course you explored the use of
research to identify all the possible customer groups that might be
interested in a company or organization’s offerings, as well as typical
customer buying behaviors. In Unit 3 of this course you explored the
communication tactics that companies and organizations use to introduce
their offerings to the potential customer groups they have identified
(also known as target markets).*  
    
 *Assume that a company has been successful in its endeavors to identify
customers who will buy its offerings, and that the company has
effectively communicated with these customers to the point at which the
customers have purchased products and/or services from the company.
While this development may sound like a success unto itself, the company
must continue its efforts to satisfy these customers so that they
continue to buy the company’s offerings. To improve the likelihood of
repeated transactions with its customers, a company must continue to
develop and manage these relationships.*  
    
 *In this unit of the course, you will explore the importance of the
ongoing relationships that companies create with their customers and the
tactics that companies use to maintain and develop these relationships.*
